**Created**: 2026-05-07

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items passed validation on first iteration.
- FR-001 through FR-014 cover complete CRUD for both entities plus search/filter, navigation, and notifications.
- User stories are properly prioritized: P1 for core CRUD (both entities), P2 for search/filter enhancement.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers — all aspects had reasonable defaults based on the detailed user description.
